# Privacy Policy for Wawa

**Last Updated**: February 8, 2026  
**Effective Date**: February 8, 2026

## Introduction

Wawa ("we", "our", or "the extension") is a browser extension designed to help users export their X/Twitter data locally. This Privacy Policy explains our commitment to your privacy and details how the extension handles your data.

## Core Privacy Principle

**Wawa operates on a zero-data-collection model.** We do not collect, transmit, store on external servers, or share any of your personal information or browsing data.

## What Data Does Wawa Access?

### Data Accessed Locally

To perform its core function of exporting your tweets, Wawa accesses the following data **only on your local device**:

1. **Twitter/X GraphQL API Responses**
   - Tweet content (text, timestamps, IDs)
   - Author information (username, display name, verification status)
   - Engagement metrics (likes, retweets, replies)
   - Media URLs (if present in tweets)
   
2. **Rate Limit Information**
   - HTTP headers from X/Twitter API (`x-rate-limit-limit`, `x-rate-limit-remaining`, `x-rate-limit-reset`)
   - Used solely to prevent excessive requests and respect Twitter's rate limits

3. **User Preferences**
   - Extension settings (export options, data format preferences)
   - Stored locally in Chrome's storage API

### How Data is Processed

All data processing occurs **entirely within your browser**:

- **Interception**: Wawa intercepts X/Twitter GraphQL API responses as you browse
- **Storage**: Data is temporarily stored in your browser's IndexedDB or Chrome local storage
- **Export**: You manually download exports as JSON files to your chosen location
- **No Transmission**: No data is ever sent to external servers, analytics services, or third parties

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Only

1. **IndexedDB** (`wawa_resume_db`)
   - **Purpose**: Stores in-progress exports to enable pause/resume functionality
   - **Location**: Your browser's local IndexedDB storage
   - **Retention**: Automatically deleted 6 hours after last activity or when you complete an export
   - **Access**: Only accessible by Wawa within your browser

2. **Chrome Local Storage** (`chrome.storage.local`)
   - **Purpose**: 
     - Stores user preferences (export settings)
     - Fallback storage if IndexedDB is unavailable
   - **Location**: Chrome's local storage partition
   - **Retention**: Persists until you clear browser data or uninstall the extension

3. **Downloaded Files**
   - **Purpose**: Your exported tweet data
   - **Location**: Your computer's download folder (you choose the location)
   - **Format**: JSON files
   - **Control**: Entirely under your control; delete or manage as you see fit

### No Cloud Storage

Wawa does **not** use any cloud storage services. All data remains on your device.

## What Data is NOT Collected

Wawa explicitly does **NOT** collect, access, or transmit:

- ❌ Browsing history
- ❌ Personal identification information beyond what's in your public tweets
- ❌ Login credentials or authentication tokens
- ❌ Private messages or DMs
- ❌ Financial information
- ❌ Health information
- ❌ Analytics or usage statistics
- ❌ Crash reports or error logs sent to external servers
- ❌ IP addresses
- ❌ Device information
- ❌ Location data

## Third-Party Access

### No Third-Party Services

Wawa does **not**:
- Use analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics)
- Include tracking pixels or beacons
- Connect to advertising networks
- Share data with data brokers
- Integrate with social media platforms (other than reading public X/Twitter data)

### No External Network Requests

The extension makes **no network requests** to external servers. The only network activity is:
- Intercepting existing X/Twitter API calls your browser already makes while browsing X.com
- These requests are made by X/Twitter's own web interface, not initiated by Wawa

## Permissions Explained

Wawa requests the following Chrome permissions:

### 1. Storage (`storage`)
- **Purpose**: Save user preferences and temporarily store export progress
- **Justification**: Enables resume functionality for large exports and persists your settings
- **Data Access**: Only data generated by Wawa (export payloads, settings)

### 2. Unlimited Storage (`unlimitedStorage`)
- **Purpose**: Store large export datasets (users with 25,000+ tweets generate 100MB+ of data)
- **Justification**: Standard Chrome storage quota (~10MB) is insufficient for comprehensive exports
- **Data Access**: Same as above, just allows larger volumes

### 3. Host Permissions (`*://*.x.com/*`, `*://*.twitter.com/*`)
- **Purpose**: Inject the export button and intercept API responses on X/Twitter pages
- **Justification**: Required to access the DOM and network responses on X/Twitter domains
- **Scope**: Limited to X/Twitter domains only

## User Control and Data Management

### Deleting Your Data

You have complete control over your data:

1. **Clear In-Progress Exports**:
   - Open the extension popup
   - Click "Clear Logs"
   - Or: Clear browser data (Chrome Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data → Check "Cookies and other site data")

2. **Delete Settings**:
   - Uninstall the extension (removes all local storage)
   - Or: Clear browser data as above

3. **Delete Downloaded Exports**:
   - Simply delete the JSON files from your download folder

### Uninstalling the Extension

When you uninstall Wawa:
- All local storage is automatically cleared by Chrome
- In-progress exports are deleted
- Settings are removed
- Downloaded files remain on your computer (you control these)

## Children's Privacy

Wawa does not knowingly collect data from anyone, including children under 13. Since the extension operates entirely locally and collects no data, COPPA compliance is inherent.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect:
- Changes in browser APIs or extension capabilities
- Legal or regulatory requirements
- User feedback

Significant changes will be announced via:
- GitHub repository updates
- Extension update notes in the Chrome Web Store

## Transparency and Open Source

Wawa is **open source**. You can verify our privacy claims by reviewing the source code:
- **Repository**: https://github.com/ragaeeb/wawa
- **License**: MIT License

Our code is publicly auditable, ensuring transparency in how we handle your data.

## Your Rights

Since Wawa does not collect or transmit your data, traditional data rights (access, deletion, portability) are not applicable. However:

- **You already have full access** to your data (it's stored locally)
- **You can delete data anytime** (clear browser storage or uninstall)
- **Your data is already portable** (JSON export files you download)

## Security

### Local-First Security

Because all data processing occurs locally:
- Your data never traverses the internet (except as part of normal X/Twitter browsing)
- No risk of server breaches or data leaks from our side
- No central database to compromise

### Your Responsibilities

To protect your exported data:
- Store downloaded JSON files securely
- Use strong passwords for your device
- Be cautious sharing export files (they contain your tweet history)

## Compliance

### GDPR (European Union)

While Wawa does not collect personal data, we respect GDPR principles:
- **Lawful basis**: Not applicable (no data collection)
- **Data minimization**: We access only data necessary for export functionality
- **Purpose limitation**: Data accessed is used solely for local export
- **Storage limitation**: Temporary storage only (6-hour expiry for in-progress exports)

### CCPA (California)

Under CCPA, Wawa qualifies for exemptions as:
- We do not "sell" personal information
- We do not "share" personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising
- We do not collect personal information for commercial purposes
